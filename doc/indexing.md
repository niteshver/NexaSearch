# Indexing

After document processing, NexaSearch builds optimized search indexes that enable fast and relevant retrieval across millions of technical documents.

Each processed document is assigned a unique document ID and enriched with metadata before indexing.

The indexing pipeline includes:

- Document ID generation
- Metadata indexing
- BM25 lexical indexing
- Dense embedding generation
- Vector indexing
- Hybrid index creation
- Incremental index updates

NexaSearch maintains both lexical and semantic indexes to support hybrid search, combining keyword matching with semantic retrieval for improved search quality.
