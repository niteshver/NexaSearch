## Data Sources

NexaSearch is designed to crawl multiple technical sources using source-specific configurations. Each supported domain can define its own crawling strategy, allowing the crawler to adapt to the structure, content type, and rate limits of different websites.

Instead of using a single configuration for every source, NexaSearch applies per-domain settings such as crawl strategy, URL patterns, crawl limits, and relevance filtering.
